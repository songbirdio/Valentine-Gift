    <p>Like everyone we meet, we share a memory with them. But the memories i share with you
        are not just memories, purposeful encounters. Being my best friend when life was weighing,
        when i was confused about a lot of things, being a support, an ear that listens, a presence
        i felt the most.

    <h2>Our story isn't finished…</h2>
    <p>Whenever it gets tough, remember this conversation during our 2nd year anniversary</p>
    <p>Funmi: Hey baby, 💗 
This last two years has been about the best years of my life and you were a key
 player in it. Thank you so much for all the beautiful experiences, timeless 
 memories, locked-in habits, teachings, stretching and connections. Thank you 
 for loving me effortlessly and bringing out the very best in me. You have 
 made me see through your eyes -a million times in these past two years- just 
 how amazing I am and how much I can be. You've thought me to cherish myself 
 better,...infact, to do *IT*(everything) better; love, grow,read, discern, 
 connect... Thank you for being my life's mirror ❤️
<br>
Thank you for seeing me, hearing me, putting me before yourself and watching 
out for me even when it seems  difficult to do. You are an amazing person, 
you are really kind. Two years can not be penned down completely but in all, 
you are the perfect match for me, I'm proud to be your best friend and 
girlfriend, no one can do it better than you. I cherish you so much and I'm 
glad we've come this far 🥰💕.
<br>

   I want you to know the many times you think "you're not doing enough", 
   that you're doing your best and your best is amazing. Look at how much 
   I've grown academically, emotionally,...how every aspect of my life is 
   continually in check and I don't have to even do it (even if I still do 
   because I see you getting better and I must step my game too. Not because 
   it's a competition but because best friends twin) because I know you're 
   right there for me🤍✨
<br>
  I'm proud of how much you're ever ready to grow and learn, it's one big 
  reason I'm sticking around (forever), 😂. You are doing great and I  
  appreciate you.
  <br>
Thank you for making me a better person and for continually pushing to be 
the best (even though to me, you are perfect...almost always). The timeless 
memories, laugh, experiences, love, and the ones to come, I'm grateful for 
them and more grateful I get to have them with you 😌💝 
<br>
HAPPY 2ND ANNIVERSARY BABE 🎊 🎉
Here's to forever ❤️♾️🥂</p>
<p>
    Saint: Hey Babe,

This is my love letter to you, to mark the continuation of a journey that 
looked like mythology to many. It's been two years filled with a lot of 
miracles, emotions, amazing memories, shortcomings, funky behaviors, offending 
and defending days, spiritual and less spiritual days, romantic and nonsense 
behavior (that one you will never miss it), busy and free days, risky and 
blossoming days. These two years saw the best and worst of ourselves. And 
still we are here already making history many 60 yrs married couples haven't 
been able to achieve. 
<br>
I celebrate us today, às this is both a formal and informal way of making 
sure you are aware that this boy loves the hell out of you and is ready to do 
anything for you.
<br>
First I appreciate you for accepting to be my Best friend and Girlfriend 
exactly today 2 years ago, I can only remember how I felt after you said yes, 
and took the flower from me. I will love to do that again and again. Bc you 
deserve all of the happiness I can give and more than I have now.
<br>
No one accepts to date a boy like me, e no dey normal to do. But you looked 
beyond the no-fine face and no-fine pocket and believed my promise of a better 
friendship. Thank you.
<br>
Oluwafunmilayo was the name you told me you're called. But when I searched 
deeper, I found out that this is just a cheat code God used. I asked God for 
this inner joy and satisfaction, and he hid it inside a human being. 
Funmi - Given to me, Ayo - Joy (Streams of Joy), Oluwa - My God, My God..😊😊 
e no funny again. But I just told God "I saw what you did there"
<br>
Thank you for being a pillar I stood on and grew with all these years. Only God 
in Heaven can reward you enough for your Love and the security you brought 
into my life even when it should have been the other way round. And you have 
never complained.
<br>
Thank you for your patience with me, thank you for your care for me, thank you 
for being a normal woman with all the disturb disturb and not easy to predict 
behaviors. I'm happy I pulled this one for my self, so at least when men gather 
to talk about the woman in their lives, I can have something to talk about. 
I love the drama, I love the peace, I love the 'are you ok?', and I love the 
'babe we will pull this through'. My heart has been heavy in thoughts of tears 
and Joy. Life would have been different if you had said NO to me. So thank you baby.
<br>
To continue serving my purpose in your life is what I really want to continue 
doing. I want to continue growing so I can have what to teach you. I want to 
continue developing so I can know what to do at all times to make you the 
happiest Girl on earth. Make your mama envy you join. I want to be there and 
see you become the Great image God had in mind bringing you into this world.
<br>
Distant but you're close to my heart and will always stay there I Promise. 
I promise to be a source of peace and accommodate your newly updated dramas,
I'll be a really man and be your shield when you are emotionally down. 
I'll be right here.
<br>
May God in Heaven preserve what we have and has built so nothing breaks this 
bond in Jesus Name...
<br>
HAPPY 2 YEARS into our Relationship, and not many more numbers until marriage 
in Jesus Name. <br>Amen
